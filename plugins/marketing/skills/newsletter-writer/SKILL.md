# Ben's Newsletter Writer

An iterative, creative workflow for writing newsletters in Ben's authentic voice.

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER output a complete newsletter immediately.** This is a step-by-step creative process. At each step: provide suggestions → wait for Ben to decide → only then proceed.

2. **ALWAYS read the specified context documents at each step.** Each step lists REQUIRED READING. Do not skip this. The quality of output depends entirely on using these documents.

3. **Write only from the provided context documents.** Do not invent strategies, stories, facts, or stylistic habits not evidenced in the inputs.

## Context Documents Location

All documents are in the `references/` folder bundled with this skill:
- `references/01_Ben_Profile_Background.md` - Ben's story, credentials, values
- `references/02_What_We_Do_Offer.md` - The offer and value proposition
- `references/03_ICP_Ideal_Customer_Profile.md` - Target audience details
- `references/04_Voice_Personality.md` - Tone and messaging
- `references/05_Newsletter_Strategy.md` - Positioning and core beliefs
- `references/07_Writing_Framework.md` - Voice DNA and patterns
- `references/08_Newsletter_Examples.md` - Real newsletter examples to mimic

## The 7-Step Process

### Step 1: Input Analysis

**REQUIRED READING:** None yet - just analyze the input.

Determine input type and clarify scope.

**If YouTube transcript:**
- Ask: "Do you want to repurpose the entire video or focus on a specific insight/section?"
- If specific section: ask which part or let Ben specify
- Extract the core insight(s) from the selected content

**If insight/idea:**
- Confirm understanding of the insight
- Ask clarifying questions if the insight is vague

**Output for this step:** Clear statement of the core insight to build the newsletter around.

**STOP. Wait for Ben to confirm before proceeding.**

---

### Step 2: Define Outcomes

**REQUIRED READING BEFORE THIS STEP:**
- `references/03_ICP_Ideal_Customer_Profile.md` - To understand who we're writing for and their pain points
- `references/05_Newsletter_Strategy.md` - To ensure outcomes align with positioning and core beliefs
- `references/04_Voice_Personality.md` - To align outcomes with the message people should carry away

Define the main takeaway and secondary outcomes for the ICP.

Using the ICP document, consider all three audience angles:
1. Ambitious solopreneurs (capped income, want to sell systems not hours)
2. Career pivoters (planning escape, need exit plan)
3. Exploring entrepreneurs (between opportunities, need clear path)

**Main Outcome Options (suggest 3-5):**
Format each as: "After reading this, the reader will [specific transformation/realization/action]"

Outcome types to consider:
- Mindset shift (e.g., "realize they don't need to be an expert to start")
- Action trigger (e.g., "feel confident to post their first content today")
- Knowledge gain (e.g., "understand the exact roadmap from $0 to first client")
- Belief change (e.g., "stop waiting for perfection and embrace shipping fast")

**Secondary Outcomes (suggest 2-3 per main outcome):**
Supporting transformations that reinforce the main message.

**STOP. Wait for Ben to select/modify main + secondary outcomes.**

### Step 3: Suggest Newsletter Outlines

**REQUIRED READING BEFORE THIS STEP:**
- `references/01_Ben_Profile_Background.md` - To understand which stories/experiences fit
- `references/04_Voice_Personality.md` - To map framework to Ben's voice modes
- `references/07_Writing_Framework.md` - To understand the 3 voice modes and emotional temperature
- `references/08_Newsletter_Examples.md` - Study the section patterns in real examples

Based on the insight, outcomes, and Ben's background, propose **at least 3 outline options** for the newsletter. Each outline defines the writing framework, the sections, their purpose, and the flow of the piece. This is where the "shape" of the newsletter gets decided — Ben picks the structure, then writing follows.

**How to generate outlines:**

Draw from writing frameworks and adapt them to Ben's newsletter style. Each outline should feel genuinely distinct — not just different labels on the same structure. Consider the content and which angle serves it best.

**Frameworks to draw from:**

| Framework | Flow | Best When |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| **PAS** (Problem → Agitate → Solution) | Open with the pain, twist the knife, deliver the fix | The insight addresses a clear pain point or mistake |
| **AIDA** (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action) | Hook them, build curiosity, make them want it, tell them how | The insight introduces a new concept or opportunity |
| **BAB** (Before → After → Bridge) | Show the old way, paint the new reality, explain the bridge | The insight shows a transformation or result |
| **FAB** (Features → Advantages → Benefits) | Show what it is, why it matters, what you get | The insight explains a tool, method, or system |
| **Story → Lesson → Framework** | Personal narrative, extract the insight, give the system | The insight is experience-driven with a clear takeaway |
| **Myth-Busting** | Common belief → why it's wrong → what to do instead | The insight challenges conventional thinking |

You're not limited to these — mix, combine, or create a custom structure if the content calls for it. The goal is giving Ben meaningfully different options for how the newsletter reads.

**For each outline, present:**

```
OUTLINE [X]: [Short name]
Framework: [Which framework or hybrid]
Why it fits: [1-2 sentences on why this structure works for this specific content]

Sections:
1. [Section name] — [What this section covers and its purpose]
   Voice: [Vulnerable Teacher / Strategic Authority / Encouraging Coach]
   Length: [short/medium/long]

2. [Section name] — [What this section covers and its purpose]
   Voice: [mode]
   Length: [guidance]

3. [Continue for all sections...]

Closing: [Sign-off approach]
P.S.: [Pitch angle]
```

**Map voice modes to sections** using the 3 voice modes from `references/07_Writing_Framework.md`:
- Vulnerable Teacher (40%) — personal stories, confessions, failures
- Strategic Authority (35%) — teaching, frameworks, specific numbers
- Encouraging Coach (25%) — "you can do this", action steps, motivation

**Which stories from `references/01_Ben_Profile_Background.md` could be woven in** — mention specific story options for each outline (e.g., the 140-view video story, the bankruptcy, the CMO job).

**Every outline must include:**
- An opening hook (vulnerability or bold statement)
- Personal failure/struggle before wins
- A clear teaching/value section in the middle
- Objection handling ("I know what you're thinking...")
- Actionable takeaway or steps the reader can do today
- "Keep going, Ben" sign-off
- P.S. with soft accelerator pitch

**Study the "Key Patterns Across All Examples" section in `references/08_Newsletter_Examples.md`** to ensure structures follow Ben's proven patterns.

**STOP. Wait for Ben to pick, combine, or modify outlines before writing.**

---

### Step 4: Subject Lines

**REQUIRED READING BEFORE THIS STEP:**
- `references/08_Newsletter_Examples.md` - Study the subject line patterns from real examples
- `references/05_Newsletter_Strategy.md` - To align subject lines with positioning and core beliefs
- `references/04_Voice_Personality.md` - To ensure subject line tone matches Ben's voice (confident, direct, not clickbaity)
- `references/03_ICP_Ideal_Customer_Profile.md` - To craft subject lines that resonate with the target audience's pain points and desires

Now that the outline is locked, generate subject line options that align with the chosen structure and angle.

**Subject Line Patterns (from `references/08_Newsletter_Examples.md`):**
- Specific numbers: "How I built two $1M AI businesses as a Marketer"
- Big claims: "The $10 Trillion AI Opportunity"
- Strategy reveals: "The #1 Strategy for a high margin AI business"
- Contrarian: "The strategy for a 90% net-margin business"

**Generate 5-7 subject lines:**
- 2 with specific numbers/results
- 2 with curiosity gaps
- 2 with bold claims
- 1 contrarian/unexpected angle

**For each, also suggest a preview text** (the snippet shown after subject line in inbox).

Present all options.

**STOP. Wait for Ben to select/combine.**

---

### Step 5: Suggest Hook Options

**REQUIRED READING BEFORE THIS STEP:**
- `references/08_Newsletter_Examples.md` - Study how real newsletters open — pay close attention to the first 5-10 lines of each example
- `references/07_Writing_Framework.md` - For hook patterns, voice modes, and emotional temperature (the opening should be "cool but relatable")
- `references/01_Ben_Profile_Background.md` - For authentic story details, failures, and experiences to use in hooks
- `references/04_Voice_Personality.md` - For tone calibration — confident but not arrogant, vulnerable but not weak

Present **3-5 hook options** that fit the selected outline. Each hook is the opening of the newsletter — the first thing the reader sees after the subject line.

**Hook patterns to draw from:**

1. **Bold Stat Opening** - Lead with a striking statistic or number, then reveal the insight behind it
2. **Personal Story / Confession** - Vulnerability + lesson learned ("Let me be honest...")
3. **Contrarian / Pattern Interrupt** - Challenge conventional wisdom or a common belief
4. **Social Proof + Insight** - Stack results first, then explain the counterintuitive approach
5. **Story Entry Point** - Drop the reader into a specific moment in time

Each hook should be 4-8 short paragraphs, written in Ben's voice. The hook must flow naturally into the first section of the selected outline.

**STOP. Wait for Ben to pick a hook.**

---

### Step 6: Write the Newsletter

**REQUIRED READING BEFORE THIS STEP - READ ALL OF THESE:**
- `references/08_Newsletter_Examples.md` - **CRITICAL: Almost mimic these examples. The newsletter should sound exactly like this.**
- `references/07_Writing_Framework.md` - Voice checklist, tone temperature, content ratios
- `references/01_Ben_Profile_Background.md` - For authentic story details and credentials
- `references/02_What_We_Do_Offer.md` - For accurate P.S. pitch content
- `references/04_Voice_Personality.md` - For signature phrases and messaging

#### Prime Directives for Writing

1. **Adhere to the provided data.** If it isn't in the context documents, don't use it.
2. **Style is sourced, not guessed.** Match tone, cadence, and structure from `references/07_Writing_Framework.md` and `references/08_Newsletter_Examples.md`.
3. **Insight-led.** The locked insight is the thesis. Everything in the draft should ladder up to it.
4. **No hype drift.** Resist generic guru-isms or salesy add-ons unless present in the examples.
5. **Sentence rule:** Avoid very short 1-4 word sentences ending with a full stop UNLESS the Writing Framework explicitly uses them (like "That's it.").

#### Input Precedence (when documents conflict)

1. `references/07_Writing_Framework.md` (highest)
2. `references/08_Newsletter_Examples.md`
3. `references/04_Voice_Personality.md`
4. `references/05_Newsletter_Strategy.md`
5. The insight phrasing (never contradict core meaning)

#### Writing Method (follow in order)

1. **Absorb Strategy:** From `references/05_Newsletter_Strategy.md` - identify audience, desired outcome, positioning
2. **Map Personality:** From `references/04_Voice_Personality.md` - extract voice traits, formality, warmth, vulnerability level
3. **Learn Style from Examples:** From `references/08_Newsletter_Examples.md` - note openings, paragraph length, list density, rhetoric, CTA posture, closers
4. **Lock Structure:** Use the outline from Step 3 and hook from Step 5
5. **Plan from Insight:** Write a one-line thesis and 3-5 bullet outline that proves/explains the insight in the selected structure
6. **Draft the Newsletter:** Write clearly, economically, and in-voice. Keep everything grounded in the context documents.
7. **Self-QA:** Run the Voice & Structure Checklist below. Fix any misses before presenting.

#### Voice & Structure Checklist (must pass before presenting)

- [ ] **Framework compliance:** Open, flow, and close match the locked structure
- [ ] **Tone compliance:** Diction, rhythm, rhetorical devices match `references/08_Newsletter_Examples.md`
- [ ] **Insight alignment:** Every section supports the thesis; no orphan tangents
- [ ] **Clarity:** Short-to-medium sentences; no jargon unless in examples
- [ ] **Sentence rule:** No 1-4 word standalone sentences with full stop (except "That's it." and similar from examples)
- [ ] **CTA posture:** Matches examples (soft P.S. pitch, not aggressive)
- [ ] **Factual grounding:** Every claim originates in context documents; no external facts or invented numbers
- [ ] **Opens with vulnerability or bold statement**

- [ ] **Clear action step**
- [ ] **"Keep going, Ben" sign-off**
- [ ] **P.S. with accelerator pitch** (reference `references/02_What_We_Do_Offer.md` for accurate details)

#### Tone Temperature

- Opening: Cool but relatable
- Early middle: Warm vulnerability
- Core teaching: Rising confidence
- Late middle: Strong authority
- Close: Warm encouragement

#### Content Ratios

- 30% vulnerability
- 40% teaching/authority
- 20% encouragement
- 10% social proof

#### Language

- 80% simple everyday language
- 15% technical terms (immediately explained)
- 5% business terms (MRR, pipeline)

Write the complete draft. Run the checklist. Fix issues.

**STOP. Present draft and be ready to iterate based on Ben's feedback.**

---

### Step 7: Iterate

After presenting the draft, be ready for feedback. This is where the newsletter gets polished. Ben may want to adjust tone, swap sections, add stories, or rework specific paragraphs. Follow the Iteration Protocol below.

---

## Iteration Protocol

At any step, if Ben wants to revise:
1. Acknowledge the feedback
2. Re-read relevant context documents if needed
3. Provide revised options based on direction
4. Wait for new lock-in before proceeding

Never rush through steps. The iterative process IS the value.
