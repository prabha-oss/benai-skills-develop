# Research Guide

How to analyze inspiration sites and extract design direction for customization.

## When User Shares an Inspiration URL

### Step 1: Fetch and Analyze

Use `WebFetch` immediately with this prompt structure:

```
Analyze this website for design extraction:
- Primary colors (hex codes)
- Secondary/accent colors
- Background colors
- Typography: heading font, body font, font sizes
- Spacing patterns (tight, normal, generous)
- Layout approach (centered, asymmetric, full-width)
- Hero style (text-focused, image-focused, video, illustration)
- Animation style (none, subtle, dramatic)
- Overall vibe in 3 words
```

### Step 2: Report Back

Present findings to the user:

```
"I analyzed [site]. Here's what I extracted:

COLORS:
- Primary: #XXXXXX (describe: bold blue, soft sage, etc.)
- Secondary: #XXXXXX
- Background: #XXXXXX
- Accent: #XXXXXX

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Headings: [font name] - [weight] - [style description]
- Body: [font name] - [size pattern]
- Character: [modern, classic, playful, etc.]

LAYOUT:
- Structure: [centered content / full-width / asymmetric]
- Spacing: [tight / normal / generous whitespace]
- Grid: [12-col / flexible / single column]

HERO TREATMENT:
- Style: [text-heavy / image-focused / video / split]
- Animation: [none / subtle fade / dramatic entrance]

VIBE: [3 words that capture the feel]

Is this the direction? What specifically do you like about it?"
```

### Step 3: Clarify Preferences

Ask follow-up questions:

```
"From this inspiration, I want to confirm:

1. Colors - Use these exact colors, or just the 'feel'?
2. Typography - Match the font style, or suggest alternatives?
3. Layout - Follow this structure closely, or just take inspiration?
4. Animations - Include similar motion, or keep it simpler?
"
```

## Competitor Analysis

If user shares a competitor link:

### What to Look For

1. **Messaging gaps** - What are they NOT saying that you could?
2. **Visual opportunities** - If they're corporate, you could be bold
3. **Positioning holes** - Markets they ignore
4. **Tone differences** - How can you sound different?

### Report Format

```
"I analyzed [competitor]. Opportunities I see:

THEY SAY: [their main message]
YOU COULD SAY: [alternative positioning]

THEIR VIBE: [description]
YOUR OPPORTUNITY: [how to differentiate visually]

THEY TARGET: [their audience]
YOU COULD OWN: [underserved segment]
"
```
