# Interview Questions

Use these when the user chose "Interview me" mode.
Go section by section. Use `AskUserQuestion` wherever possible.

**Important:** Don't dump all questions at once. Complete one section, summarize what
you captured, confirm with the user, then move to the next.

## Section 6: The Results

Where the story pays off. Push for specifics.
