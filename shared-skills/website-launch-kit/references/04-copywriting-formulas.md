# Copywriting Formulas

Frameworks and formulas for writing landing page copy.

## Core Principle

**The user's words become the copy.** Extract language from the intake conversation. Their phrases resonate with their audience because they speak the same language.

## Headline Formulas

### Formula 1: Outcome + Audience
```
[Desired outcome] for [specific audience]
```
Examples:
- "Automation that scales for founders who'd rather grow than grind"
- "Websites that convert for B2B SaaS companies"

### Formula 2: Problem Elimination
```
Stop [pain point]. Start [desired state].
```
Examples:
- "Stop chasing leads. Start closing deals."
- "Stop drowning in manual work. Start scaling."

### Formula 3: Transformation
```
From [before state] to [after state]
```
Examples:
- "From overwhelmed founder to focused CEO"
- "From scattered processes to seamless automation"

### Formula 4: Direct Promise
```
[We/I] [action] [outcome]
```
Examples:
- "We build websites that actually convert"
- "I help founders reclaim 10 hours a week"

### Formula 5: Question Hook
```
[Question that triggers recognition]?
```
Examples:
- "Tired of websites that look pretty but don't convert?"
- "What if your marketing ran itself?"

### Formula 6: Contrarian
```
[Challenge conventional wisdom]
```
Examples:
- "You don't need more leads. You need better systems."
- "The best marketing doesn't feel like marketing."

## Subheadline Formulas

### Support the Headline
```
[How you deliver on the headline promise]
```
Example:
- H1: "Automation that scales"
- Sub: "Custom n8n workflows that save 20+ hours per week"

### Add Specificity
```
[Specific method/approach/differentiator]
```
Example:
- H1: "Websites that convert"
- Sub: "Data-driven design + conversion-focused copy in 2 weeks"

### Handle Objection
```
[Address the 'yeah but' in their head]
```
Example:
- H1: "Scale without hiring"
- Sub: "No code knowledge required. We handle everything."

## Body Copy Frameworks

### PAS (Problem - Agitate - Solution)

**Problem:** State the pain point clearly
**Agitate:** Make them feel it (consequences, frustration)
**Solution:** Introduce your answer

```
[Problem]
You're spending hours on tasks that should take minutes.

[Agitate]
Every manual process is money left on the table. Your competitors
are automating while you're still copy-pasting between tools.

[Solution]
We build custom automation that handles the boring stuff,
so you can focus on what actually grows your business.
```

### AIDA (Attention - Interest - Desire - Action)

**Attention:** Hook them immediately
**Interest:** Build curiosity with benefits
**Desire:** Make them want it
**Action:** Tell them exactly what to do

### BAB (Before - After - Bridge)

**Before:** Where they are now (the struggle)
**After:** Where they could be (the dream)
**Bridge:** How you get them there

```
[Before]
Right now, you're juggling 10 tools, missing follow-ups,
and working weekends to keep up.

[After]
Imagine: automated workflows that run while you sleep,
leads that nurture themselves, and weekends that are actually free.

[Bridge]
That's what we build. Custom automation tailored to your business.
```

### FAB (Features - Advantages - Benefits)

**Features:** What it is
**Advantages:** What it does
**Benefits:** What that means for them

```
[Feature] Custom n8n workflows
[Advantage] Automate repetitive tasks across all your tools
[Benefit] Save 20+ hours per week and never miss a lead again
```
