## 1. Carousel Hook Templates

Best for: educational content, step-by-step guides, listicles, and multi-slide posts.

### 1.1 A Unique Process

**Why it works:** "How I" implies a unique process that stirs intrigue. Reframes how to think about a common asset. Impressive results lend credibility.

**Template:**

```

### 1.13 New vs Old

**Why it works:** Leverages the contrast principle — highlighting differences and comparisons draws attention. "Old" evokes a sense of nostalgia for long-time users.

**Template:**
```
New [platform/tool/version] vs. Old [platform/tool/version]
(+ [Content type/functionality])
```

### 1.14 Studying The Classics

## Core Principles for Writing Great Hooks

1. **Specificity wins.** Replace vague placeholders with precise numbers, names, timeframes, and outcomes. "I grew my audience by 10,000 in 90 days" beats "I grew my audience quickly."
2. **Curiosity gap.** The hook should open a question in the reader's mind that the post body answers. Don't give away the punchline in the hook.
3. **Pattern interrupt.** Say something the reader doesn't expect to see on LinkedIn. Contrarian takes, vulnerability, humor, and bold claims all break the scroll pattern.
4. **Brevity.** The best hooks are 1-3 lines. Front-load the most compelling word or phrase. Every word must earn its place.
5. **Relevance to audience.** A hook only works if it speaks to something the target audience cares about. Tie into their goals, fears, frustrations, or aspirations.
6. **One idea per hook.** Don't cram multiple angles into the opening. Pick the single most compelling thread and pull it.
