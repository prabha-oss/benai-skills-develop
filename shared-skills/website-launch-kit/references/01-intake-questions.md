# Intake Questions Reference

Deep conversation framework to understand the user's business and landing page requirements.

## How to Ask Questions

**IMPORTANT:** Always use the `AskUserQuestion` tool for intake questions. This shows a clean modal with selectable options.

### Rules

1. Ask **ONE question at a time** — never combine multiple questions
2. Every question **MUST** use the `AskUserQuestion` tool
3. Provide **2-4 clear options** per question
4. **Wait** for the user's answer before asking the next question
5. Do **NOT** ask questions as plain text in the chat

### Tool Format

```
AskUserQuestion(
  question: "Your single question here",
  options: [
    { label: "Option 1", description: "Brief explanation" },
    { label: "Option 2", description: "Brief explanation" },
  ]
)
```

🔌 INSTALL CLAUDE BROWSER EXTENSION

This lets me analyze websites directly when you share them.

Install here:

```

**Wait for user to confirm they installed it OR they want to skip.**

**Step 8.2 - Show Browsing Links**
