Example 1: Domain Expertise + AI = Unfair Advantage
Type: Insight / Mindset Shift

Most domain experts don't realize they're sitting on a goldmine.

They think AI is for developers and tech people.

But here's one of the biggest takeaways after 2 years in AI:

Domain expertise + AI = Unfair advantage.

I worked with brilliant developers who could write beautiful code.

But they couldn't solve real business problems.

They didn't understand:
↳ The real problem they were solving
↳ What good copy looks like
↳ How to prompt AI models properly
↳ The business logic behind systems

Marketing, Sales, CS and other non-technical domain experts have the context that 20-year developers are missing.

They understand the "why" and "how" of business processes.

They tend to have an edge in natural language prompting to guide AI models.

And with AI democratizing coding, we're at a historic moment.

Domain experts can now learn to solve their day to day problems in days, not years.

Naval Ravikant said it best:

"Learn to build. Learn to sell. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable."

2 years ago, I didn't know what a JSON was.

People now consider me an "AI expert."

Without writing a single line of code.

But I still see most people falling in the same traps:
↳ "n8n & claude code are too technical for me"
↳ "I don't have time"
↳ "These skills will become irrelevant"

Meanwhile, non-technical people are taking the leap.

Learning n8n & claude-code in weeks.

And building 6-figure businesses in months.

Here's the truth:

There are no "AI experts" yet.

The experts are being created NOW.

It's the people who prioritize experimenting.

99% will keep convincing themselves this isn't for them.

Be the 1%.

Example 2: Brand-Aligned Infographics with AI
Type: Tutorial / How-To

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗼 (𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆) 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗱-𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗽𝗵𝗶𝗰𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗔𝗜 𝗶𝗻 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝘂𝘁𝗲𝘀:

Most AI image tools butcher your brand style and can't spell.

Nano Banana Pro just changed that.

Here's how I use it to create infographics for LinkedIn posts and newsletters.

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟭: 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘁
➝ Add clear instructions for infographic structure
➝ Include your exact brand color codes (hex values)
➝ Specify your brand fonts by name
➝ Comment "Infographic" to get my system prompt

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟮: 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗽 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗜𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀
➝ Reference images make AI copy structure, not style
➝ Color codes + font names work better
➝ The AI follows instructions more accurately
➝ You get unique designs, not copies

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟯: 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗚𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗩𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀
➝ Add the most insightful part of your content
➝ Pick aspect ratios
➝ Export in 4K for maximum quality
➝ Create a few versions (or use my tool to generate 6 at once)
➝ Pick the best one for your content

Example 3: The Prioritization Framework
Type: Personal / Life Advice

2 years ago, I changed the way I set goals.

And it changed my life.

Instead of a list of goals, I defined what parts in life I was going to prioritize.

But more importantly, I defined what I was NOT going to prioritize.

Why?

Because most ambitious people fail on their goals, not because they are not motivated.

But because they simply set too many.

You can't get a business of the ground, have your best social life, travel the world AND be in the best shape of your life.

So every year, I look at this list below and I rate myself from 1-10 on each of the points for the past year.

Then I pick 2 out of these 9 points in my life that I want to prioritize more over the next year.

Health:
➝ Mind
➝ Soul
➝ Body

Social:
➝ Romance
➝ Family
➝ Friends

Work:
➝ Mission
➝ Money
➝ Growth

Why does it work?

In the era of social media, FOMO is real. You will always be reminded of what you don't have. What you are NOT doing.

And prioritizing one area will mean another might suffer a bit. That isn't failure, that is a trade-off.

So when FOMO thoughts creep in, reminding yourself of the priorities you set instantly resolves your doubts.

2 years ago, I prioritized my mission and body. I wanted to quit my job, get my business of the ground, and get in good shape.

So when doubts started creeping in on a Sunday behind my desk while my friends were out, I knew I was doing the right thing.

And I succeeded in both.

This year I prioritized money and family.

Did I travel the world, spent hours building friendships or find perfect mental balance? No.

But I earned more than I ever have and spent more time with family than in the last decade.

The same principle applies to building a business. You have to pick your season.

If you are just starting out, your season is lead generation.

You have to be fine not knowing every AI Tool, being underpaid every once in a while or your product not being perfect.

Those are the trades you make to win.

"Most people overestimate what they can do in a year, but underestimate what they can do in 5".

Instead of trying to win every category at once, this system helps me build a life where different areas get their turn, one year at a time.

Pick your priorities. Be okay with the trade-offs.

What are yours for 2026? 🎯

Example 4: The 30-Day Rule
Type: AI Agency Advice / Actionable

If you want to build an AI Agency in 2026:

Don't spend more than 30 days learning AI Automation.

Here's what I've seen across 1,000+ community members:

The ones who spend months learning? They're still learning.

The ones who gave themselves 30 days and went out the market? They have clients.

I learned this the hard way.

My first startup failed because I spent too much time building a "perfect product" based on assumptions.

No customers. No feedback. Just us in a room convinced we knew what people wanted.

Well, we didn't.

When I started my AI business, I did the opposite.

I gave myself a few weeks to learn n8n and Make.com.

Then I started a YouTube channel before I even knew what I was going to sell.

My second video got 300 views, which landed my first real client.

The learning didn't stop. It happened while I was building.

Here's my rule now:

30 days to learn the basics ➝ Building ➝ Testing.

Then you go out and find your first customers.

You'll learn more applying and landing your first paid project than in 6 months of infinite tutorials.

The goal isn't to feel ready.

The goal is to start before you're ready 🛠️
