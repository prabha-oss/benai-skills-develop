## Section Customization Rules

1. **Match tone to content** - Problem section can be darker/moodier, solution brighter
2. **Vary layouts** - Don't repeat the same grid pattern twice
3. **One CTA focus per section** - Don't dilute with multiple actions
4. **Visual anchors** - Every section needs a focal element
5. **Breathing room** - Generous spacing between sections
6. **Transition flow** - Each section should lead to the next logically
