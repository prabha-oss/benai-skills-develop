# BenAI Operations

You have the following operations skills available. Present them to the user in a clean table and ask what they'd like to work on:

| Skill | Command | What it does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| n8n Automation | `/n8n` | Build, test, and deploy n8n workflows via REST API |
| n8n Blueprint Generator | `/n8n-prd-generator` | Convert discovery call transcripts into automation blueprints |

Ask the user which skill they want to use, then invoke that skill's slash command.
