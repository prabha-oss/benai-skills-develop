# Newsletter Strategy

## Value Proposition

"Skip the AI theory trap and build your $10K/month AI business in 90 days - using proven systems from someone who's actually done it (AI agency, AI product, AI education, AI services)."

## Category

AI Business Acceleration for Domain Experts

We exist at the intersection of three categories:

AI/Automation Education (technical training)
Business Acceleration (GTM, sales, scaling)
Community-Led Learning (peer support, accountability)

## The Arch Enemy

The AI Tutorial Industrial Complex

The endless cycle of:

YouTube tutorials teaching you to build demos no one will pay for
Expensive courses ($2K-10K) that leave you with certificates but no clients
AI hype merchants selling dreams without implementation
"Gurus" teaching what they've never built themselves
The comfortable trap of learning instead of earning
The myth that you need to be an AI expert before starting

## Our Position vs The Enemy

We're the anti-guru, anti-hype, anti-perfectionism movement.

While others teach you to build impressive demos, we teach you to get your first paying client.
While others sell you $5K courses on becoming an "AI expert," we give you $97/month access to systems that generate revenue.
While others preach overnight success, we share the uncomfortable truth: building a business is hard, but distribution (not technical skills) is what actually matters.

Our mantra: "Real builds. Real clients. Real revenue. From someone actually doing it."

## Core Beliefs / Point of View

### 1. Distribution > Perfection

95% of aspiring AI entrepreneurs never launch because they're stuck in the learning trap. Your first project should feel uncomfortable. You'll learn more in one client project than six months of tutorials.

### 2. Domain Expertise + AI = Unfair Advantage

You don't need to be an AI expert. You need to be one step ahead of the people you help. Non-technical professionals with domain expertise are better positioned than most AI engineers.

### 3. Custom First, Product Second

Everyone wants to build a "scalable productized business" from day one. That's the expensive mistake. Build custom first, let customers tell you what to productize, then scale what's proven.

### 4. High-Leverage Work > Hard Work

Most people work hard. Successful people work hard on high-leverage activities. Stop perfecting your tech stack. Start practicing acquisition. That's the only skill that compounds forever.

### 5. Build in Public = Infinite Distribution

You're not behind - you're in an AI bubble. Outside this bubble, 99% of businesses haven't implemented a single automation. Show up consistently on one channel for 90 days.

## Controversial Truths We Stand For

Your first client will expose you as a fraud (that's normal)
YouTube with 500 views beats 50,000 LinkedIn connections
$97 spent on the right system beats $5,000 on the wrong course
You're already qualified enough to start today
Most "AI experts" are one YouTube video ahead of you
The best time to start was yesterday; the second best is now
Work-life balance is yearly, not daily (grind hard for 2-3 years, then take a year off)

## The Core Narrative: From AI Consumer to AI Business Owner in 90 Days

### Act 1: The Trap (Current State)

You're stuck. Not because you lack skills. You're stuck because you're doing what feels comfortable: consuming AI content, building demos, perfecting your landing page, waiting until you're "ready." Meanwhile, AI is disrupting your industry.

### Act 2: The Shift (The Realization)

Then you discover the uncomfortable truth: the skill that matters isn't building better AI systems - it's getting clients. Distribution beats perfection. Done beats perfect. You're already one step ahead of 99% of businesses.

### Act 3: The Build (The Journey)

You pick ONE channel. You commit to 2 hours daily on lead generation. You post about what you're learning. You feel like an impostor. Then your first call books. You say yes despite the anxiety. You figure it out as you go.

### Act 4: The Scale (The Outcome)

Project one leads to referral two. Patterns emerge. You standardize. You raise prices. You hit $3K/month, then $5K, then $10K. Not because you became an AI expert, but because you got comfortable being uncomfortable.

### The Meta Message

This newsletter follows the same journey. I'm not teaching theory - I'm sharing what I'm building right now. My wins, my mistakes, my systems. You're watching someone build to $100K MRR in real-time. If I can do it (physiotherapist turned AI entrepreneur), so can you.
