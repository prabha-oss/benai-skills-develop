# Slide Types Library

This is NOT a fixed structure. It's a menu of slide types to compose from.
The user and AI together decide which slides to include and in what order.

## Slide Selection Guidelines

### For a tight sales deck (5-7 slides):
Title → Challenges → Actions → Results → Quote → CTA

### For a standard case study (8-10 slides):
Title → Executive Summary → Challenges → Objectives → Actions → Results → Quote → Conclusion → CTA

### For a comprehensive showcase (12-15 slides):
Title → Executive Summary → About Client → Challenges → Objectives → Actions (multi) → Evidence → Results → Before/After → Quote → Final Thoughts → Next Steps → Team → CTA

### Always ask the user which structure fits their need.
