## 1. Iceberg

**When to use:** The concept has a visible surface and a much larger hidden depth. "What people see vs. what's really going on."

**What it shows:** Two layers — a small visible portion above the waterline and a massive hidden portion below.

**Visual style:** Clean split between above/below water. Light blue sky above, deep blue/teal below. Floating text labels on each side.

**Layout:**
```
    ┌──────────────┐
    │  "What you   │  ← Above water (small)
    │    see"      │
    ╠══════════════╣  ← Waterline
    │              │
    │  "What's     │  ← Below water (large, 3-4x)
    │   really     │
    │   happening" │
    │              │
    └──────────────┘
```

**Example prompt snippet:** "An iceberg infographic showing [topic]. Above the waterline in a small section: [visible items]. Below the waterline in a much larger section: [hidden items]. Clean flat illustration style."

**Best for:** Skills vs effort, success vs sacrifice, obvious vs subtle, symptoms vs root causes.

---

## 2. Pyramid

**When to use:** Concepts with hierarchical levels, where the base is broad/foundational and the top is narrow/aspirational.

**What it shows:** Layered tiers from wide base to narrow peak. Each tier represents a level.

**Visual style:** Stacked horizontal bands with distinct colors. Labels centered in each band. Widest at bottom, narrowest at top.

**Layout:**
```
         /\
        /  \       ← Top tier (pinnacle/goal)
       /    \
      /──────\
     /        \    ← Middle tiers
    /──────────\
   /            \  ← Base tier (foundation)
  /──────────────\
```

**Example prompt snippet:** "A pyramid infographic with [N] tiers. Base: [foundation concept]. Middle tiers: [progression]. Top: [pinnacle]. Each tier a different pastel color with white text labels."

**Best for:** Maslow's hierarchy, skill levels, maturity models, priority frameworks.

---

## 3. Tangled vs Straight Line

**When to use:** Showing the contrast between complexity/chaos and simplicity/clarity. Before vs after. Problem vs solution.

**What it shows:** Two paths side by side — one messy/tangled, one clean/straight. Both start and end at the same points.

**Visual style:** Left side has a chaotic scribble line. Right side has a clean straight or gently curved line. Both connect point A to point B.

**Layout:**
```
  ┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
  │  BEFORE     │  AFTER      │
  │             │             │
  │  A ~~╮╭~~  │  A ────── B │
  │    ╰╯╰╯   │             │
  │      ~~~ B │             │
  └─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

**Example prompt snippet:** "A split infographic. Left side labeled '[before state]' shows a tangled, messy line path from start to finish. Right side labeled '[after state]' shows a clean, straight path. Minimal flat design."

**Best for:** Process improvement, simplification, problem-solving, before/after transformation.

---

## 4. U-Curve Journey

**When to use:** Transformation that involves going through a dip before rising. The "it gets worse before it gets better" pattern.

**What it shows:** A U-shaped curve where the journey starts high, dips down (the hard part), then rises back up to a higher point.

**Visual style:** A bold U-curve line with labeled stages along the path. Starting point on the left, dip at the bottom, rise on the right. Key milestones marked with dots or icons.

**Layout:**
```
  High ●                          ● Higher
       │\                        /│
       │ \    "The Dip"         / │
       │  \                    /  │
       │   \        ●        /   │
       │    \      / \      /    │
       │     \    /   \    /     │
       │      \──/     \──/      │
  Start                      End
```

**Example prompt snippet:** "A U-curve journey infographic showing [topic]. Starting high at [initial state], dipping through [challenge phase], rising to [improved state]. Labels at key points along the curve. Warm gradient background."

**Best for:** Learning curves, career transitions, startup journeys, change management, recovery stories.

---

## 5. Hourglass / Bowtie

**When to use:** Concepts that converge to a narrow point then expand again. Filtering, focusing, or bridging two broad areas through a single bottleneck.

**What it shows:** Wide top section narrowing to a center point, then expanding wide again at the bottom.

**Visual style:** Symmetrical shape. Top and bottom sections filled with different content. The narrow middle represents the key connection point or bottleneck.

**Layout:**
```
  ╲            ╱
   ╲  Wide    ╱   ← Broad input
    ╲        ╱
     ╲      ╱
      ╲    ╱
       ╲  ╱      ← Narrow focus point
       ╱  ╲
      ╱    ╲
     ╱      ╲
    ╱        ╲
   ╱  Wide    ╲   ← Broad output
  ╱            ╲
```

**Example prompt snippet:** "An hourglass infographic. Top wide section: [broad inputs/many options]. Narrow middle: [key decision/filter/bottleneck]. Bottom wide section: [broad outputs/results]. Pastel colors, clean labels."

**Best for:** Sales funnels that expand, convergent-divergent thinking, input-output models, bottleneck analysis.

---

## 6. Silhouette with Branches

**When to use:** One central concept that has many parts, aspects, or outcomes branching from it. Tree-like thinking.

**What it shows:** A central figure (head, body, tree trunk) with branches, roots, or extensions representing the many facets of the concept.

**Visual style:** A recognizable silhouette (often a person's head profile or a tree) with labeled branches extending outward. Each branch represents a different aspect.

**Layout:**
```
              Branch 1
             /
    Branch 2/
           /
  ┌──────────┐──── Branch 3
  │ Central  │
  │ Concept  │──── Branch 4
  └──────────┘
           \
    Branch 5\
             \
              Branch 6
```

**Example prompt snippet:** "A silhouette of [a human head / a tree] with [N] branches extending outward. Each branch is labeled with [aspects]. The silhouette is filled with [color]. Clean flat illustration, white background."

**Best for:** Skills of a role, aspects of a concept, growth mindset, knowledge trees, organizational structure.

## 8. Split Comparison

**When to use:** Comparing two things side by side. Old vs new, good vs bad, option A vs option B.

**What it shows:** Two halves of the image, each representing one side of the comparison. Clear visual distinction between the two.

**Visual style:** Vertical split (or diagonal). Left side has one color scheme, right side has another. Matching elements on each side for easy comparison.

**Layout:**
```
  ┌──────────┬──────────┐
  │  OLD     │  NEW     │

## 9. Concentric Circles / Bullseye

**When to use:** Concepts with a core idea surrounded by expanding layers. Importance radiates outward, or context builds from the center.

**What it shows:** Nested rings expanding from a central point. The center is the core/most important element.

**Visual style:** Rings of increasing size with decreasing color intensity (darkest at center). Labels in each ring or connected by lines.

**Layout:**
```
       ╭─────────────╮
      ╱  ╭─────────╮  ╲
     ╱  ╱  ╭─────╮  ╲  ╲

A PROCESS or SEQUENCE?
  └─→ Timeline (chronological) or Funnel (narrowing) or Steps (how-to)

HIDDEN DEPTH?
  └─→ Iceberg (surface vs depth)

TRANSFORMATION?
  └─→ U-Curve (dip then rise) or Tangled-to-Straight (complex to simple)

PARTS of a WHOLE?
  └─→ Donut (proportions) or Silhouette with Branches (categories)

CONVERGENCE?
  └─→ Hourglass (narrow then expand) or Funnel (just narrow)

OVERLAP?
  └─→ Venn Diagram (2-3 things intersecting)
```

## Tips for Metaphor Selection

1. **Match the concept's natural shape** — Don't force a pyramid onto a comparison concept
2. **One metaphor per infographic** — Mixing metaphors creates confusion
3. **Consider text density** — Funnels and timelines hold more text than icebergs
4. **Think about the "aha moment"** — Which metaphor makes the insight click fastest?
5. **Series potential** — Some metaphors (timeline, steps) naturally extend across multiple posts
6. **Invent when needed** — If no standard metaphor fits, create a custom visual that serves the concept
