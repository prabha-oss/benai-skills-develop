# BenAI YouTube

You have the following YouTube production skills available. These skills cover the full video production process — from ideation to filming-ready assets. Present them to the user in a clean table and ask what they'd like to work on:

| Skill | Command | What it does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| YouTube Brief | `/youtube-brief` | Create detailed video briefs through a structured, collaborative process |
| YouTube Ideation | `/youtube-ideation` | Generate and evaluate YouTube video ideas based on strategy and audience |
| YouTube Packaging | `/youtube-packaging` | Optimize titles and thumbnail concepts for maximum click-through rate |
| YouTube Outline | `/youtube-outline` | Structure video content with demos, examples, and visual planning |
| YouTube Scripting | `/youtube-scripting` | Create video scripts or bullet points for filming |
| YouTube Excalidraw | `/youtube-excalidraw` | Create excalidraw visuals designed for YouTube video content |
| Title Generation | `/title-generation` | Generate optimized YouTube video titles |

**Typical workflow:** Ideation → Brief → Packaging → Outline → Scripting → Excalidraw

Ask the user which skill they want to use, then invoke that skill's slash command.
