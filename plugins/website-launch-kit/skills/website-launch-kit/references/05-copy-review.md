"Got it - going with [their choice] for [element]. Moving to the next section."
```

### When User Wants Changes

```
"I hear you. What would you change about it? Or give me a direction and I'll revise."
```

Then provide 2-3 new options based on their feedback.

### When User Likes Parts of Multiple Options

```
"Let's combine them. Taking [X] from Option A and [Y] from Option B:

'[Combined version]'

Does that nail it?"

## Rules for Copy Review

1. **Always give 3 options** - Never just one, never more than 4
2. **Explain the difference** - Why each option takes a different angle
3. **Respect their voice** - Use their words when possible
4. **Don't overwhelm** - One section at a time
5. **Confirm before moving** - Get explicit approval
6. **Allow mixing** - They can combine elements from different options
7. **Iterate willingly** - If none work, write new ones based on feedback
