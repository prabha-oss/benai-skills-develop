# Visual Reasoning Framework

How to think about content to discover the right visualization. This is not about matching keywords to templates — it's about understanding the **shape of the idea** and finding a visual form that makes that shape visible.

---

## The Core Principle

**Every idea has a shape. Every infographic tells a story. Your job is to find both.**

When a user shares content, don't immediately think "what template fits?" Instead, ask:

> "What STORY does this tell, and what SHAPE does that story take?"

The story is the **narrative arc**. The shape is the **visual metaphor**.

---

## Narrative Arcs for Infographics

Before finding the visual shape, identify the STORY the infographic tells:

### The 4 Core Narrative Arcs

| Arc | The Story | Viewer Emotion | Example Content |
|-----|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Myth → Reality** | "You think X, but actually Y" | Surprised, corrected | "What people think success looks like vs. what it actually takes" |
| **Surface → Depth** | "Here's what's hidden beneath" | Curious, enlightened | "The 90% of effort nobody sees" |
| **Chaos → Order** | "From complex to simple" | Relieved, empowered | "How to simplify your workflow" |
| **Journey → Destination** | "Follow these steps to get there" | Motivated, guided | "The path to mastery" |

### How Narrative Arc Shapes Metaphor Choice

| Arc | What the Visual Must Do | Best Metaphors |
|-----|------------------------|----------------|
| Myth → Reality | Show contrast between two states | Split comparison, Tangled→Straight |
| Surface → Depth | Reveal layers or hidden content | Iceberg, Layers, Concentric circles |
| Chaos → Order | Show transformation/simplification | Tangled→Straight, Funnel |
| Journey → Destination | Show progression/stages | Timeline, Pyramid, Steps, U-curve |

**Ask yourself:** Which arc does the user's content follow? This narrows your metaphor options before you even analyze the content's shape.

---

## The 6-Step Reasoning Process

### Step 0: Identify the Narrative Arc

Before analyzing the content's shape, identify which story it tells:

**Ask:** "Is this content about..."
- Correcting a misconception? → **Myth → Reality**
- Revealing hidden depth? → **Surface → Depth**
- Simplifying complexity? → **Chaos → Order**
- Showing a progression? → **Journey → Destination**

This immediately narrows your metaphor options and frames the rest of your analysis.

### Step 1: Extract the Core Tension

Every compelling insight contains a **tension** — two forces, states, or ideas in relationship. Find it.

**Ask yourself:**
- What's being compared to what?
- What's hidden vs. visible?
- What transforms into what?
- What contains what?
- What leads to what?

**Examples:**

| User's Content | Core Tension |
|---------------|--------------|
| "What people see as overnight success vs. years of work" | Visible vs. hidden |
| "Junior → Senior → Lead → Principal" | Levels of growth |
| "Raw data becomes insight becomes decision" | Transformation sequence |
| "Strategy, tactics, and execution must align" | Parts that must connect |
| "Focus on these 3 things, ignore everything else" | Essential vs. noise |

### Step 2: Identify the Relationship Type

Once you have the tension, classify the **relationship** between the elements:

| Relationship Type | What It Means | Visual Shape |
|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Revelation** | Hidden truth beneath surface | Depth (iceberg, layers) |
| **Hierarchy** | Levels of importance/mastery | Vertical stack (pyramid, tiers) |
| **Transformation** | State A becomes State B | Journey (path, curve, timeline) |
| **Composition** | Parts make up a whole | Container (pie, silhouette, puzzle) |
| **Contrast** | A vs. B, either/or | Division (split, versus) |
| **Intersection** | Where things overlap | Merger (venn, overlap) |
| **Convergence** | Many become few | Narrowing (funnel, hourglass) |
| **Divergence** | One becomes many | Branching (tree, explosion) |
| **Sequence** | Steps in order | Flow (timeline, numbered path) |
| **Proportion** | Relative sizes/amounts | Area (pie, bar, sized elements) |

### Step 3: Feel the Emotional Weight

Visualizations have emotional undertones. Match the feeling:

| If the content feels... | The visual should feel... |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Surprising, revealing | Dramatic contrast (iceberg, split) |
| Aspirational, growth-oriented | Upward movement (pyramid, climb) |
| Messy → clean | Transformation (tangled→straight) |
| Complex but ordered | Systematic (layers, nested circles) |
| Overwhelming → focused | Narrowing (funnel, filter) |
| Connected, holistic | Unified (venn, composition) |

### Step 4: Map Content to Visual Structure

Now translate the specific content into the visual structure:

**For an Iceberg (revelation):**
- What's "above water" (visible to everyone)?
- What's "below water" (hidden effort/truth)?
- Is the ratio right? (Usually 20% visible, 80% hidden)

**For a Pyramid (hierarchy):**
- What's at the base (foundation/most common)?
- What's at the top (peak/aspirational)?
- How many levels? (3-5 is ideal)

**For a Timeline (sequence):**
- What's the starting state?
- What's the ending state?
- What are the key milestones between?

**For a Split (contrast):**
- What goes on the left? (Usually "before" or "wrong")
- What goes on the right? (Usually "after" or "right")
- Are the items parallel? (Old way point 1 ↔ New way point 1)

### Step 5: Validate the Fit

Before proposing, ask:

1. **Does the metaphor serve the narrative arc?**
   - Myth→Reality needs CONTRAST — does the visual show two states?
   - Surface→Depth needs LAYERS — does the visual reveal hidden content?
   - Chaos→Order needs TRANSFORMATION — does the visual show change?
   - Journey→Destination needs PROGRESSION — does the visual show movement?

2. **Does the visual match the insight's shape?**
   - If the insight is about hidden depth, does the visual show layers?
   - If it's about transformation, does the visual show movement?

3. **Would someone "get it" in 5 seconds?**
   - The metaphor should feel *inevitable*, not forced
   - If you have to explain why the visual fits, it doesn't fit

4. **Is the content naturally divisible?**
   - Iceberg needs 2 groups (above/below)
   - Pyramid needs 3-5 tiers
   - Timeline needs 3-7 steps
   - If content doesn't divide naturally, wrong metaphor

## Thinking Patterns for Common Content Types

### "The Hidden Truth" Pattern

**Content signals:**
- "What people don't realize..."
- "Behind the scenes..."
- "The real work is..."
- "What you see vs. what it takes"

**Reasoning:**
1. This is about **revelation** — surface vs. depth
2. Visual shape: **layered, depth-based**
3. Best metaphors: Iceberg, Layers, Behind-the-curtain split

**Mapping questions:**
- What's the shiny surface people see?
- What's the unglamorous reality underneath?
- Is there a clear dividing line (like a waterline)?

### "The Journey" Pattern

**Content signals:**
- "From X to Y"
- "The path to..."
- "Stages of..."
- "It gets harder before it gets easier"

**Reasoning:**
1. This is about **transformation** — state change over time
2. Visual shape: **linear with direction**
3. Best metaphors: Timeline, U-curve, Path, Steps

**Mapping questions:**
- What's the starting point?
- What's the destination?
- Is the journey linear or does it dip/rise?
- What are the key waypoints?

### "The Hierarchy" Pattern

**Content signals:**
- "Levels of..."
- "The foundation is..."
- "Build upon..."
- "At the top of the pyramid..."

**Reasoning:**
1. This is about **hierarchy** — importance or mastery levels
2. Visual shape: **stacked, vertical**
3. Best metaphors: Pyramid, Stacked layers, Ladder

**Mapping questions:**
- What's the base/foundation?
- What's the pinnacle/goal?
- How many distinct levels?
- Does each level require the ones below?

### "The Comparison" Pattern

**Content signals:**
- "A vs. B"
- "The difference between..."
- "Old way vs. new way"
- "Myth vs. reality"

**Reasoning:**
1. This is about **contrast** — two opposing things
2. Visual shape: **divided, parallel**
3. Best metaphors: Split comparison, Tangled vs. straight

**Mapping questions:**
- Are there exactly two things being compared?
- Are the comparison points parallel (A has X, B has X)?
- Is one clearly "better" or are they equal alternatives?

### "The System" Pattern

**Content signals:**
- "These 3 things work together..."
- "The components of..."
- "How X, Y, and Z connect"
- "The overlap between..."

**Reasoning:**
1. This is about **composition** or **intersection**
2. Visual shape: **interconnected, bounded**
3. Best metaphors: Venn, Concentric circles, Silhouette with parts

**Mapping questions:**
- Are the components overlapping or separate?
- Is there a hierarchy among components?
- Is there a "core" that others surround?

### "The Funnel" Pattern

**Content signals:**
- "From many to few..."
- "Filtering down..."
- "At each stage, fewer..."
- "The selection process..."

**Reasoning:**
1. This is about **convergence** — narrowing
2. Visual shape: **wide to narrow**
3. Best metaphors: Funnel, Hourglass, Filter

**Mapping questions:**
- What enters at the top (the many)?
- What emerges at the bottom (the few)?
- What are the filtering stages?
- Are there numbers/percentages at each stage?

### "The Process" Pattern

**Content signals:**
- "Step 1, Step 2..."
- "First... then... finally..."
- "The workflow for..."
- "How to..."

**Reasoning:**
1. This is about **sequence** — ordered steps
2. Visual shape: **connected, numbered**
3. Best metaphors: Timeline, Numbered steps, Flow

**Mapping questions:**
- How many steps?
- Is the sequence linear or does it branch?
- Is there a clear start and end?
- Do steps have equal weight or some more important?

## When No Template Fits

Sometimes the content doesn't match any standard metaphor. That's when you **invent**.

### The Invention Process

1. **Return to the shape question:**
   > "If this idea were a physical object, what would it look like?"

2. **Think in terms of:**
   - Movement (flowing, climbing, falling, cycling)
   - Container (holding, surrounding, protecting)
   - Connection (bridging, linking, merging)
   - Transformation (becoming, evolving, breaking)

3. **Draw from the physical world:**
   - Nature: trees, rivers, mountains, ecosystems
   - Architecture: bridges, buildings, rooms
   - Machines: gears, circuits, engines
   - Human body: brain, heart, skeleton

4. **Test with a simple sketch:**
   - Can you draw the concept in 30 seconds?
   - Would someone recognize what it represents?

### Custom Metaphor Examples

| Content | Standard Fit? | Custom Metaphor |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| "3 skills that compound together" | Venn is okay but... | Mixing bowl with ingredients |
| "Building blocks of a career" | Pyramid is okay but... | Tetris pieces stacking |
| "Ideas that orbit a central philosophy" | Concentric circles but... | Solar system |
| "The back and forth of negotiation" | Timeline but... | Tennis match |

## Reasoning Checklist

Before presenting visualization options, verify your thinking:

- [ ] I identified the narrative arc (Myth→Reality, Surface→Depth, Chaos→Order, Journey→Destination)
- [ ] I identified the core tension (what vs. what)
- [ ] I classified the relationship type
- [ ] I felt the emotional weight of the content
- [ ] I mapped specific content to visual structure
- [ ] The metaphor SERVES the narrative arc
- [ ] The visual shape matches the idea's shape
- [ ] Someone would "get it" in 5 seconds
- [ ] The content divides naturally into the structure
- [ ] I'm not just keyword-matching to a template

## Example Reasoning Session

**User's content:**
> "Most people think success is about talent. But really it's 10% talent, 20% strategy, and 70% consistent execution. The boring daily work is what matters most."

**Step 0: Narrative arc**
- This is "You think X, but actually Y"
- **Myth → Reality** arc
- Also has elements of **Surface → Depth** (revealing hidden work)

This tells me: Need a visual that shows CONTRAST or REVEALS hidden content.

**Step 1: Core tension**
- Perception vs. reality
- Glamour vs. grind
- Visible vs. hidden

**Step 2: Relationship type**
- **Revelation** (hidden truth) — but also...
- **Proportion** (percentages given)

**Step 3: Emotional weight**
- Surprising, corrective, grounding
- Feels like "let me show you what's really true"

**Step 4: Map to structure**

Option A — Iceberg:
- Above water (10%): Talent (what people see)
- Below water (90%): Strategy (20%) + Execution (70%)
- Matches the "hidden depth" feeling
- **Serves the narrative arc perfectly** — reveals what's hidden

Option B — Split Comparison:
- Left: "What people think" (Talent)
- Right: "What it really is" (Execution + Strategy)
- **Serves Myth→Reality arc** — shows the contrast

Option C — Pie/Donut:
- Shows exact proportions: 10%, 20%, 70%
- But loses the "hidden vs. visible" tension
- **Doesn't serve the narrative arc** — no revelation or contrast

**Step 5: Validate**
- Iceberg: Strong fit — serves Surface→Depth arc, 10/90 split works
- Split: Strong fit — serves Myth→Reality arc, clear contrast
- Pie: Weak fit — shows proportion but doesn't serve either arc

**Recommendation to user:**
> "Your content tells a 'Myth → Reality' story — correcting what people think about success.
>
> For this arc, I see two strong options:
>
> 1. **Iceberg** — Talent visible above water (10%), strategy and execution massive below (90%). This reveals the hidden truth — what's really beneath the surface.
>
> 2. **Split Comparison** — Left side: 'What people think: Talent.' Right side: 'What it really is: Execution + Strategy.' This shows the contrast directly.
>
> The iceberg emphasizes the *hidden depth*. The split emphasizes the *correction of belief*.
>
> Which story resonates more with your message?"

## Key Mindset

Don't think: "What template fits this content?"

Think: "What **story** does this content tell, and what **shape** makes that story visible?"

1. First, find the **narrative arc** — what story is being told?
2. Then, find the **shape** — what visual form serves that story?

The templates are starting points, not destinations. The goal is always: **make the insight click instantly through the right story told in the right shape**.
